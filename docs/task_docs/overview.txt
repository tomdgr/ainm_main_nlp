Tripletex — AI Accounting Agent
Build an AI agent that completes accounting tasks in Tripletex. You receive a task prompt (in one of 7 languages), use the Tripletex API to execute it, and get scored on correctness and efficiency.

How It Works
Submit your HTTPS endpoint URL on the platform
We provision a fresh Tripletex sandbox account
We send a randomly selected accounting task to your /solve endpoint
Your agent reads the prompt, optionally processes attached files (PDFs, images)
Your agent calls the Tripletex API via a proxy to complete the task
We verify the result field-by-field against expected values
Your score updates on the rolling leaderboard
Each submission gets a brand new Tripletex account — you always start from scratch.
