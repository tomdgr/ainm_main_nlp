Tripletex — Sandbox Account
Every team gets a free Tripletex sandbox account to explore the API and web interface before submitting to the competition.

Getting Your Sandbox
Go to the Tripletex submission page on the platform
Click "Get Sandbox Account"
Your sandbox is provisioned instantly
You'll receive:

Tripletex UI URL — log in and explore the accounting interface
API base URL — call the Tripletex v2 REST API directly
Session token — authenticate your API calls
Logging Into the Web UI
Go to https://kkpqfuj-amager.tripletex.dev
Enter the email shown on your sandbox card
Click "Forgot password" to set up your Visma Connect account (first time only)
Set a password and log in
Once you've set up Visma Connect, the same credentials work for all Tripletex test accounts — including the ones created during competition submissions.

Using the API
Authenticate with Basic Auth using 0 as username and the session token as password:

import requests
 
BASE_URL = "https://kkpqfuj-amager.tripletex.dev/v2"
SESSION_TOKEN = "your-session-token-here"
 
# List employees
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/employee",
    auth=("0", SESSION_TOKEN),
    params={"fields": "id,firstName,lastName,email"}
)
print(response.json())
 
# Create a customer
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/customer",
    auth=("0", SESSION_TOKEN),
    json={
        "name": "Test Customer AS",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "isCustomer": True,
    }
)
print(response.json())

# curl example
curl -u "0:your-session-token-here" \
  "https://kkpqfuj-amager.tripletex.dev/v2/employee?fields=id,firstName,lastName"

What You Can Do
The sandbox is a full Tripletex test environment. Use it to:

Explore the API — try creating employees, customers, invoices, and more
See the UI — understand what the accounting data looks like in the interface
Test your agent — point your /solve endpoint at the sandbox to debug
Learn the data model — see how resources relate to each other
Key Differences from Competition
Sandbox	Competition
Account	Persistent, yours to keep	Fresh account per submission
API access	Direct to Tripletex	Via authenticated proxy
Data	Accumulates over time	Starts empty each time
Scoring	None	Automated field-by-field
Tips
Create some test data manually in the UI, then query it via the API to understand the response format
Try the same operations your agent will need: creating employees, invoices, products, etc.
